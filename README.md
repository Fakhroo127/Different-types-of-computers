      <h2>Super computer</h2>
      <p>A super computer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. The performance of a super computer is commonly measured in floating point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS).The first super computer, Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600, was created in the 1960s. Super computers are widely used in the field of weather forecasting, cryptography, data mining, and more. They are huge systems with multiple processing units and are capable of performing high-level computation. Super computers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling, and physical simulations. They have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis. Here is an image of a supercomputer</p>

      <h2>Mainframe computer</h2>
      <p>A mainframe computer is a type of computer that is designed to handle large-scale computing tasks and data processing for organizations. Mainframes are capable of processing billions of calculations and transactions in real-time, securely and reliably. They are used primarily by large organizations for critical applications like bulk data processing for tasks such as censuses, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing. Mainframes are data servers that are designed to process up to 1 trillion web transactions daily with the highest levels of security and reliabilityability. here is a picture of mainframe computer. </p>

      <h2>Micro computer</h2>
      <p>A micro computer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer having a central processing unit (CPU) made out of a microprocessor. The computer also includes memory and input/output (I/O) circuitry together mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB). Micro computers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors 1. They are characterized by their small size, low cost, and ease of use. Many micro computers are also used as personal computers. Micro computers are used in a wide range of applications, including home automation, industrial automation, medical devices, and more. Some popular examples of micro computers include the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Intel NUC. here is apicture of micro computer. </p>
